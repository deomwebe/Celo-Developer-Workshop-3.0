## Developer tools and resources

This section contains information about some of the key tools and resources that will help developers start building applications on Celo.

For a comprehensive list of resources and information, review [Celo Docs.](https://docs.celo.org/)

### QUICK START GUIDES

View the [Developer Code Examples page](https://docs.celo.org/developer#quickstart) to get started using the Celo SDKs with guided coding exercises.

### Tutorials

- [Tutorial - Celo Developer Blog](https://docs.celo.org/blog)

### TOOLS

#### Boilerplates

- [celo-composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer#celo-composer)
  - Celo Composer allows you to quickly build, deploy, and iterate on decentralized applications using Celo. It provides a number of frameworks, examples, and Celo specific functionality to help you get started with your next dApp.

#### SDKs

- [ContractKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer/contractkit#what-is-contractkit)
  - Javascript package of Celo blockchain utilities
  - Manage connections to the Celo blockchain, accounts, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, etc.
  - A set of wrappers around the core protocol smart contracts to easily connect with contracts related to governance, validators, on-chain exchange, etc.
  - Includes [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/)
- [Celo Ethers.js Wrapper](https://github.com/celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper) (experimental)
  - A minimal wrapper to make [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) compatible with the Celo network
- [use-react](https://github.com/celo-org/react-celo)
  - The easiest way to access Celo in your React applications ðŸ”¥. react-celo is a React hook for managing access to Celo with a built-in headless modal system for connecting to your users wallet of choice.
  - Now your DApp can be made available to everyone in the Celo ecosystem, from Valora users to self custodied Ledger users.
  - By default react-celo is styled so that you can drop it into your application and go, however it's fully customisable so you can maintain a consistent UX throughout your application.
- [DappKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/dappkit)
  - Easily connect to the [Valora](http://valoraapp.com/) wallet with your React Native mobile application
  - Valora manages user account, private keys and transaction signing, so you can focus on building your dapp
  - Learn more and see the code with the [Dappkit truffle box](https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-dappkit)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/blaize-tech/celo-sdk-py)
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/blaize-tech/celo-sdk-java)
  - [Android with Java SDK](https://github.com/bcamacho/celo-android-java-sdk-test-example)
- [iOS SDK](https://github.com/heymateag/celoiossdk)

#### Infrastructure

- [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) provides a clean, intuitive UI where users can send transactions and interact with smart contracts
- [Forno](https://stackedit.io/developer-guide/forno)
- Node access service so you can connect your dapp to the Celo blockchain without having to run node infrastructure
- [ODIS](https://stackedit.io/developer-resources/contractkit/odis.md)
- Oblivious decentralized identity service
- Lightweight identity layer that makes it easy to send cryptocurrency to a phone number
- Blockscout block explorers
- [Alfajores testnet](http://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/) & [mainnet](http://explorer.celo.org/)
- [Stats.celo.org](http://stats.celo.org/) to check network activity and health

#### Networks

- [Alfajores Testnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet)
- [Faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) for free testnet CELO and cUSD
- [Forno](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/forno) supports connections to alfajores
- Requires Alfajores Celo wallet for mobile device testing (please request, support@clabs.co)
- [Baklava testnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet) for validators and testing protocol changes

#### Ethereum Tools

- Similarities between Celo and Ethereum means you can use many of the most popular Ethereum developer tools.
- Celo supports the EVM, so tools for writing smart contracts in Solidity (or any language that compiles to EVM bytecode) are compatible with Celo
- ERC20, NFT (ERC721) and other smart contract interface standards are supported, see [Celo for Ethereum Developers](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/celo-for-eth-devs)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
